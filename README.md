# Invisible-Digital-Watermarking-
The project "Image Watermarking for copyright authentication" aims to develop a robust system for protecting digital images from unauthorized use and distribution. Digital watermarking techniques will be employed to embed a unique and invisible signature in the image, which can be used to identify the owner of the picture. The project will focus on developing efficient algorithms for embedding and extracting digital watermarks that can withstand common attacks such as cropping, compression, and other forms of image alteration.
The effectiveness of the proposed system in protecting digital images from copyright infringement will be evaluated through a series of experiments. The images are modified for these experiments using image processing techniques like compression, blurring, filtering, etc.
These experiments will assess the system's ability to accurately identify the owner of a watermarked image and detect unauthorized modifications.
